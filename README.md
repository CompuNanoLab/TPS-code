# TPS-code

- Reconstruction of proton and C6+ spectra from TPS signals.
- The code take a MCP image and allow the recontraction of the proton and carbon ion spectra interactively.
- It exploits the Hough transofrmation with y-yc=a*(x-xc)^2.
- A exaple of processed data is reported in Figure_example.png
- In the # Set analysis parameters # section, set the inputs (e.g. the name of the MCP file)
